# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Customer Payment Processing

## Issue Identified
- ₹1 payment incorrectly reduces ₹1000 pending amount to zero
- Production backend has flawed pending amount calculation logic
- Affects customer payment records via "Record Payment" button

## Root Causes Fixed
1. **Missing data validation** in order processing
2. **Unsafe pending amount sync** that zeros out valid amounts
3. **Insufficient logging** to debug payment flow
4. **No safeguards** against data loss during calculation errors

## Fixes Applied
1. Added comprehensive payment flow logging
2. Implemented data validation for order amounts
3. Added safety checks to prevent erroneous zero amounts
4. Enhanced error handling for malformed order data
5. Protected customer pending amounts from incorrect calculations

## Files Modified
- `server/utils/pending-calculator.ts` - Core payment logic fixes
- Added detailed console logging for production debugging
- Implemented safety mechanisms to preserve customer data

## Deployment Required
The fixed code needs to be deployed to production to resolve the payment bug.
