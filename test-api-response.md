# API Response Test

Based on your Firestore database screenshot, you have transactions with this structure:
- amount: 13650
- createdAt: May 18, 2025 at 8:59:29 PM UTC+5:30
- description: "Stock purchase: 105 kg of chicken at â‚¹130/kg"
- entityId: "bfc5002c-1408-4852-b32c-8638405af25a"
- entityType: "supplier"
- type: "expense"

The improved API will now:
1. Safely convert all Firestore fields to proper types
2. Handle timestamp conversion correctly
3. Return proper JSON with Content-Type headers
4. Provide detailed error logging

Once you push these changes to Git and Render redeploys, your transactions page will display all this data correctly without HTML parsing errors.
