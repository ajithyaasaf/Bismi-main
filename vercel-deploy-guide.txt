SIMPLE VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX

Your Error: "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module but got HTML"
This happens because Vercel is serving HTML instead of your JavaScript files.

SOLUTION (3 steps):

1. In your Vercel dashboard, set these build settings:
   - Build Command: vite build
   - Output Directory: dist/public
   - Install Command: npm install

2. Add this environment variable in Vercel:
   - VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://bismi-main.onrender.com

3. Your vercel.json is now simplified to just:
   {
     "buildCommand": "vite build",
     "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
   }

That's it! This tells Vercel to:
- Only build your frontend (not the backend)
- Put the built files in the right place
- Connect your frontend to your existing backend on Render

Your backend on Render stays untouched and working.
